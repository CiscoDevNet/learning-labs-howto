# What is a Learning Lab?

Learning Labs are intended to be relatively short self-paced exercises to introduce someone to developer-oriented technologies. They can encompass basic developer tooling such as Postman and
Git, but typically the intention is to teach about Cisco developer technologies (APIs, SDK, etc.). A lab should take someone from start to completion on the low end 15 minutes, and on
the longer end 40 minutes. We recommend that you include at least a beginner lab that will give a sense of the technology because we have a mixed audience, many of which are new to
programming. You can build up complex labs as well so long as they don't take longer than 40 minutes.

These labs are intended to be available on the Internet under a Creative Commons License. If Cisco hardware is needed for your Learning Lab we can work with you and have your lab
available either in the DevNet Sandbox or within a DMZ network with Internet exposure. This will be considered on a case by case basis. Please reach out to the DevNet team either through
[email](https://developer.cisco.com/form/contactUs), [forums](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/forums/) or [live chat in Cisco Spark](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/). More information can be found at https://developer.cisco.com.

In order to better organize the Learning Labs and address a specific technology in more depth, we have the concept of learning tracks and modules. One or more Learning Labs that pertain to
the same technology are combined in learning modules. A combination of multiple modules intended for the same audience is organized in a learning track.

For example, we have the `Network Programmability for Network Engineers` learning track consisting of 3 learning modules. The first module covers programming foundation topics
related to network programmability like REST API basics and making API calls from Python. Once the basic concepts were introduced in the first module, the second module goes a step further
and covers in detail NETCONF and RESTCONF within 5 learning labs. The third and last module of this specific learning track, covers SDN and Cisco Network Controllers. We found that
organizing learning labs this way is more useful and we can address the right audience for each track.

If you want to create code examples that the developer can run on a workstation, please make sure you read the section on code examples later in this guide.

## A Note on Repos

The official repos for the Learning Labs content is under: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/. You will need to have a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account to create learning labs. You also need to get in contact with the DevNet team to be added to the DevNet group in GitHub. You can contact the DevNet team at https://developer.cisco.com/contactUs or in the [Cisco Spark DevNet Dev Support Questions room](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/).

# Getting Started
You can utilize [a yeoman generator to scaffold your project](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/generator-devnet-learninglabs).
You'll want to set up the structure of your Learning Labs project, which will resemble this:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project  <--  (See Note 1 below)
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```

Details on the `byod.html` and `sample-lab.json` follow this section. There is an annotated version of the `sample-lab.json` that will provide you with details for each JSON property and
its use.

Once you have created the basic structure, you should start using `git` to start tracking your changes. In order to publish into the Learning Labs platform, you will need to push to a
GitHub repository (public or private). Currently, you'll have to work with the Learning Labs managers to actually gain access and publish. Contact details were mentioned at the beginning of
this Learning Lab.

## `assets` and `samples` directories

Use the assets and samples directories as follows:

* `assets` is to be used for images for your lab.
* `samples` is to be used for any web page apps you want to include as part of your lab. Make sure you use CDNs for external libraries.

# Lab Template

In the official repo, under the `labs/sample-lab` directory, you will find a small example of a lab. This should streamline lab creation for most lab creators. Copy the sample-lab folder
with a new name to start a new project (e.g. cmx). You also need to rename `sample-lab.json` to your lab name (e.g. cmx.json).

# Lab Authoring

Lab content is created in Markdown format. See [this site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for detailed syntax documentation. As an aside, Markdown is fairly flexible, and so you can also include arbitrary HTML. The markdown files are dynamically converted to HTML when the lab is loaded. Visit <http://learninglabs.cisco.com> to see examples.

There are many Markdown editors & previewers for Mac or Windows. Using one of them may help you with formatting. I've been using Atom with a Markdown Writer and Markdown Preview Plus packages on Windows, but Sublime Text, Text Mate support Markdown. MacDown and Mou are free editors.

Common Markdown syntax:

* To insert an image: `![Figure](/posts/files/cmx/postmanlaunch.png)`
* Separate code examples with a bactick (\`)
* `<h1>` corresponds to `#`, `<h2>` to `##`, `<h3>` to `###`, and so on
* You may find it helpful to view the Markdown of this Learning Lab

*A note on image paths* -- If you are authoring outside of the Learning Labs application by just using a markdown editor, you will need to update your image paths to be
`posts/files/<labid>/<image-name>` so that they will render properly when loaded in the context of the lab application. Also, please try to follow best practices in image file size,
by attempting to make them as small as possible. A service like [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) can be useful.

## Lab content files

As mentioned above, there is a specific structure you need to use.

* Lab content is in this repository in the `/labs` directory.
* The `labId` is used as the folder name for the lab, and the labs should be broken into individual markdown files numbered 1.md, 2.md, etc. corresponding to the lab step.
* You need to follow the sample lab layout below:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project  <--  (See Note 1 below)
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```
Note 1: If you have a lab that uses an example web page for demonstrating a JavaScript library, for example, you need to include it in the `labs/sample-lab/samples` directory. You
should also link to CDN versions of dependencies like jQuery rather than bundling those into your project.

### sample-lab.json

`sample-lab.json` should be renamed and match the `sample-lab` folder name. So for example if your Learning Lab will be called Cisco-CMX-100, under the labs folder you will have to rename the `sample-lab` folder to Cisco-CMX-100 and also the `sample-lab.json` file contained in this folder to Cisco-CMX-100.json. The contents of the json file are explained below:

```
{
  "labId": "sample-lab", "_commentOnLabId": "Required",
  "title": "This is a sample lab.", "_commentOnTitle": "Required",
  "slug": "This is sample slug", "_commentOnSlug": "Required",
  "time": "5", "_commentOnTime": "Currently optional but should be required for Time sort.",
  "tags": [
    {"title": "Sample"},
    {"title": "Data Center"},
    {"title": "SDN"},
    {"title": "Mobile"}
  ],
  "files": [
    {"title": "1.md", "_comment": "This file should matchup to 1.md on the root of this lab folder."},
    {"title": "2.md", "_comment": "Otherwise it will fails deployment validation."},
    {"title": "3.md"}
  ],
  "poweredBy": "<a href=\"https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/\" target=\"_blank\">DevNet Sandbox</a>",
  "byod": true,
  "replaceAtRender": {
  	"_comment": "This following are key/value examples for Learning Labs to search/replace lab content at render time. Note that the eventName (cssandiego) below must match Learning Labs eventName name.",
  	"default": [
  		{"http://link-1.com": "http://go-to-link-a.com", "_comment": "Search/replace all 'http://link-1.com' with 'http://go-to-link-a.com'"},
  		{"{{port}}": "8080", "_comment": "Search/replace all '{{port}}' with '8080'"},
  		{"thisWord": "thatWord", "_comment": "Search/replace all 'thisWord' with 'thatWord'"},
  		{"<img src=\"thisImg\" />": "<img src=\"thatImg\" />", "_comment": "Search and replace all '<img src=\"thisImg\" />' with '<img src=\"thatImg\" />'. Note, the backslashes (\\) is for escaping double quotes."}
  		{"thisImg": "thatImg", "_comment": "Or simply use the image name."}
  	],
  	"cssandiego": [
  		{"http://link-1.com": "http://go-to-link-b.com", "_comment": "Search and replace all 'http://link-1.com' with 'http://go-to-link-b.com'"},
  		{"{{port}}": "1000", "_comment": "Search and replace all '{{port}}' with '1000'"},
  		{"thisWord": "anotherWord", "_comment": "Search and replace all 'thisWord' with 'anotherWord'"},
  		{"/cisco/gi": "Cisco", "regex": true, "_comment": "Support Regex but regex must be define as true otherwise its a string replace."}
  	]
  },
  "vms": {
  	"_comment": "Does this lab have vms? Only define this property if it does.",
		"default": [
  		{"leasing": "https://vms-server.com/api/lease"},
  		{"releasing": "https://vms-server.com/api/release"}
  	],
  	"cssandiego": [
  		{"leasing": "http://10.0.0.1/api/lease"},
  		{"releasing": "http://10.0.0.1/api/release"}
  	]
  },
  "related": [
    {
      "labId": "sample-lab-2",
      "title": "Sample Lab 2 - Sample lab to link to"
    },
    {
      "labId": "sample-lab-3",
      "title": "Sample Lab 3 - Sample lab to link to"
    }
  ],
  "authors": [
  	{"name": "Thanh Duy T Ton", "email": "thaton@cisco.com", "_commentOnAuthors": "Required"}
  ],
  "active": false, "_commentOnActive": "If not defined then the default will be true.  Disable labs in the platform by setting to false."
}
```
The json key/value pairs are self-explanatory but we will go in a bit more details on the required parameters.

The `labId` is the ID of the Learning Lab. In the example given above this would be "labId": "Cisco-CMX-100". The `title` is the actual title of the lab. In our case this could be "title":"CMX-100: Introductory concepts". The `slug` key will contain the description of the lab. For our example it could be "slug":"Learn about Cisco's CMX technologies. An introductory Learning Lab". `time` should contain the amount of time that it takes to complete the lab. We already have a lot of tags that you can choose from when defining the `tags` values. For consistency please check the already available tags when adding the values for this parameter. The `files` key should contain a list of all the md files that comprise the Learning Lab.

### BYOD Information
To enable people to complete Learning Labs you can include "bring your own device" information in the lab by including a file called `byod.html` in your directory. Author this content in HTML. This will be displayed as an "accordion" element at the top of your lab. Enable this by setting your lab JSON file property `"byod": true`.

Example file `dmo.json`:
```
{
  "labId": "dmo",
  "files": [
    {"title": "1.md"},
    {"title": "2.md"},
    {"title": "3.md"},
    {"title": "4.md"},
    {"title": "5.md"}
  ],
	"tags": [
		{"title" : "IoT"},
		{"title": "Python"},
		{"title": "Beginner"}
	],
  "byod": true,
	"authors": [
		{"name": "", "email": ""}
	]
}
```

### Related Labs
To display related labs on the completed page, you can reference other labs by adding a JSON array named `related`. You can determine the related lab ID to use by looking at the URL for a
given lab. The lab ID is contained in the path between `labs/` and `step`. Example: `#/labs/cmx/step/1` where cmx is the lab ID.

Example file `apic-em-basic.json`:
```
{
  "labId": "apic-em-basic",
  "files": [
    {"title": "1.md"}
  ],
  "related": [
    {
      "labId": "apic-em",
      "title": "APIC-EM with Python"
    },
    {
      "labId": "apic-hunt",
      "title": "APIC-EM Treasure Hunt"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Code examples
If your lab contains code examples, you should create a git project with your sample code. These examples will be hosted in GitHub, so that we can have lab participants
checkout appropriate tags and work in a read-only mode. You should include commentary in your lab on how to checkout the appropriate step. The [Angular JS tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00) is a good example of how to do this.

Note: See the example in the `labs/sample-lab` directory.

## Video files
If you'd like to include video files, you can use the HTML5 syntax like this. Since video files can be large, please work with the DevNet team to figure out the best way to add these to
the repository and site.
```
<video poster="posts/files/virl/images/ml.02.png" width="480" height="300" none controls>
<source src="/virl-static/ml.02.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
```
