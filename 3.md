# Lab Authoring

Lab content is created in Markdown format. See [this site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for detailed syntax documentation. As an aside, Markdown is fairly flexible, and so you can also include arbitrary HTML. The markdown files are dynamically converted to HTML when the lab is loaded. Visit <http://learninglabs.cisco.com> to see examples.

There are many Markdown editors & previewers for Mac or Windows. Using one of them may help you with formatting. I've been using Atom with a Markdown Writer and Markdown Preview Plus packages on Windows, but Sublime Text, Text Mate support Markdown. MacDown and Mou are free editors.

Common Markdown syntax:

* To insert an image: `![Figure](/posts/files/cmx/postmanlaunch.png)`
* Separate code examples with a bactick (\`)
* `<h1>` corresponds to `#`, `<h2>` to `##`, `<h3>` to `###`, and so on
* You may find it helpful to view the Markdown of this Learning Lab

*A note on image paths* -- If you are authoring outside of the Learning Labs application by just using a markdown editor, you will need to update your image paths to be
`posts/files/<labid>/<image-name>` so that they will render properly when loaded in the context of the lab application. Also, please try to follow best practices in image file size,
by attempting to make them as small as possible. A service like [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) can be useful.

## Lab content files

As mentioned above, there is a specific structure you need to use.

* Lab content is in this repository in the `/labs` directory.
* The `labId` is used as the folder name for the lab, and the labs should be broken into individual markdown files numbered 1.md, 2.md, etc. corresponding to the lab step.
* You need to follow the sample lab layout below:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project  <--  (See Note 1 below)
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```
Note 1: If you have a lab that uses an example web page for demonstrating a JavaScript library, for example, you need to include it in the `labs/sample-lab/samples` directory. You
should also link to CDN versions of dependencies like jQuery rather than bundling those into your project.
