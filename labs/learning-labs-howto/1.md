# What is a Learning Lab?

Learning Labs are intended to be relatively short self-paced exercises to introduce someone to developer-oriented technologies. They can encompass basic developer tooling such as Postman and
Git, but typically the intention is to teach about Cisco developer technologies (APIs, SDK, etc.). A lab should take someone from start to completion on the low end 15 minutes, and on
the longer end 40 minutes. We recommend that you include at least a beginner lab that will give a sense of the technology because we have a mixed audience, many of which are new to
programming. You can build up complex labs as well so long as they don't take longer than 40 minutes.

These labs are intended to be available on the Internet under a Creative Commons License. If Cisco hardware is needed for your Learning Lab we can work with you and have your lab
available either in the DevNet Sandbox or within a DMZ network with Internet exposure. This will be considered on a case by case basis. Please reach out to the DevNet team either through
[email](https://developer.cisco.com/form/contactUs), [forums](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/forums/) or [live chat in Cisco Spark](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/). More information can be found at https://developer.cisco.com.

In order to better organize the Learning Labs and address a specific technology in more depth, we have the concept of learning tracks and modules. One or more Learning Labs that pertain to
the same technology are combined in learning modules. A combination of multiple modules intended for the same audience is organized in a learning track.

For example, we have the `Network Programmability for Network Engineers` learning track consisting of 3 learning modules. The first module covers programming foundation topics
related to network programmability like REST API basics and making API calls from Python. Once the basic concepts were introduced in the first module, the second module goes a step further
and covers in detail NETCONF and RESTCONF within 5 learning labs. The third and last module of this specific learning track, covers SDN and Cisco Network Controllers. We found that
organizing learning labs this way is more useful and we can address the right audience for each track.

If you want to create code examples that the developer can run on a workstation, please make sure you read the section on code examples later in this guide.

## A Note on Repos

The official repos for the Learning Labs content is under: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/. You will need to have a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account to create learning labs. You also need to get in contact with the DevNet team to be added to the DevNet group in GitHub. You can contact the DevNet team at https://developer.cisco.com/contactUs or in the [Cisco Spark DevNet Dev Support Questions room](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/).
