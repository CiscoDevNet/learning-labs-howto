# Step 2: Outline the tutorial and author in Markdown

The first step in writing a Learning Lab is outlining the basic steps for a teaching tutorial. The tutorial can be anything software development, network engineering or coding tools related. It should basically not take less than 15 minutes or longer than 40 minutes to complete it. You want to give the reader a good experience with successful steps. Ideally it would also be hands on with clear steps and objectives. If you have a larger project in mind, consider breaking it into smaller pieces that each can be an individual Learning Lab. You can then organize all of them in a learning module.

## Lab authoring - Markdown

The content that you create for the Learning Lab will have to be in Markdown format. If you are not familiar with Markdown do not worry, you can think of it as a simpler version of HTML. See [this site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for detailed syntax documentation. As an aside, Markdown is fairly flexible, and so you can also include arbitrary HTML. The markdown files are dynamically converted to HTML when the lab is loaded. Visit <http://developer.cisco.com/learning> to see examples.

There are many Markdown editors and previewers for Mac, Windows or Linux. Using one of them may help you with formatting. I've been using Atom with a Markdown Writer and Markdown Preview Plus packages on Windows, but Sublime Text and Text Mate support Markdown.

Common Markdown syntax:

* To insert an image: `![Figure](assets/images/postmanlaunch.png)`
* Separate code examples with a bactick (\`)
* `<h1>` corresponds to `#`, `<h2>` to `##`, `<h3>` to `###`, and so on
* You may find it helpful to view the Markdown of this Learning Lab

*A note on image paths* -- If you are authoring outside of the Learning Labs application by just using a markdown editor, you will need to update your image paths to be
`post/files/<labid>/assets/images/<image-name>` so that they will render properly when loaded in the context of the lab application. Also, please try to follow best practices in image file size, by attempting to make them as small as possible. A service like [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) can be useful.
