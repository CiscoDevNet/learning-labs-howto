# Getting Started

## Step 1. Idea

The first step in writing a Learning Lab is coming up with an idea for it. The idea can be anything software development, network engineering or coding tools related. It should basically not take less than 15 minutes or longer than 40 minutes to complete it. Ideally it would also be hands on with clear steps and objectives. If you have a larger project in mind, consider breaking it into smaller pieces that each can be an individual Learning Lab. You can then organize all of them in a learning module.

You can also extend currently available Learning Labs. Maybe you go over the Git Learning Labs and you want to add an advanced lab to that module. That would be another way in which you can contribute to the community.

## Step 2. Lab authoring - Markdown

The content that you create for the Learning Lab will have to be in Markdown format. If you are not familiar with Markdown do not worry, you can think of it as a simpler version of HTML. See [this site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for detailed syntax documentation. As an aside, Markdown is fairly flexible, and so you can also include arbitrary HTML. The markdown files are dynamically converted to HTML when the lab is loaded. Visit <http://learninglabs.cisco.com> to see examples.

There are many Markdown editors and previewers for Mac, Windows or Linux. Using one of them may help you with formatting. I've been using Atom with a Markdown Writer and Markdown Preview Plus packages on Windows, but Sublime Text and Text Mate support Markdown.

Common Markdown syntax:

* To insert an image: `![Figure](post/files/cmx/assets/images/postmanlaunch.png)`
* Separate code examples with a bactick (\`)
* `<h1>` corresponds to `#`, `<h2>` to `##`, `<h3>` to `###`, and so on
* You may find it helpful to view the Markdown of this Learning Lab

*A note on image paths* -- If you are authoring outside of the Learning Labs application by just using a markdown editor, you will need to update your image paths to be
`post/files/<labid>/assets/images/<image-name>` so that they will render properly when loaded in the context of the lab application. Also, please try to follow best practices in image file size, by attempting to make them as small as possible. A service like [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) can be useful.

## Step 3. Organizing your files

There is a specific structure you need to use for organizing the files for your Learning Lab. You can utilize [a yeoman generator to scaffold your project](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/generator-devnet-learninglabs).
You'll want to set up the structure of your Learning Labs project, which will resemble this:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```

* Lab content is in this repository in the `/labs` directory.
* The `labId` is used as the folder name for the lab, and the labs should be broken into individual markdown files numbered 1.md, 2.md, etc. corresponding to the lab step.

Details on the `byod.html` and `sample-lab.json` follow this section. There is an annotated version of the `sample-lab.json` that will provide you with details for each JSON property and its use.

Once you have created the basic structure, you should start using `git` to start tracking your changes. In order to publish into the Learning Labs platform, you will need to push to a GitHub repository (public or private). Currently, you'll have to work with the Learning Labs managers to actually gain access and publish. Contact details were mentioned at the beginning of this Learning Lab.

## Step 4. `assets` and `samples` directories

Use the assets and samples directories as follows:

* `assets` is to be used for images for your lab.
* `samples` is to be used for any web page applications you want to include as part of your lab. Make sure you use CDNs for external libraries.
