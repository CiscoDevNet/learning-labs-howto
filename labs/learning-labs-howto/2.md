# Getting Started
You can utilize [a yeoman generator to scaffold your project](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/generator-devnet-learninglabs).
You'll want to set up the structure of your Learning Labs project, which will resemble this:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project  <--  (See Note 1 below)
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```

Details on the `byod.html` and `sample-lab.json` follow this section. There is an annotated version of the `sample-lab.json` that will provide you with details for each JSON property and
its use.

Once you have created the basic structure, you should start using `git` to start tracking your changes. In order to publish into the Learning Labs platform, you will need to push to a
GitHub repository (public or private). Currently, you'll have to work with the Learning Labs managers to actually gain access and publish. Contact details were mentioned at the beginning of
this Learning Lab.

## `assets` and `samples` directories

Use the assets and samples directories as follows:

* `assets` is to be used for images for your lab.
* `samples` is to be used for any web page apps you want to include as part of your lab. Make sure you use CDNs for external libraries.

# Lab Template

In the official repo, under the `labs/sample-lab` directory, you will find a small example of a lab. This should streamline lab creation for most lab creators. Copy the sample-lab folder
with a new name to start a new project (e.g. cmx). You also need to rename `sample-lab.json` to your lab name (e.g. cmx.json).
