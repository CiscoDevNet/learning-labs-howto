# Step 3: Organize your files

There is a specific structure you need to use for organizing the files for your Learning Lab. You can utilize [a yeoman generator to scaffold your project](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/generator-devnet-learninglabs) or [a cookie-cutter to create the template files for a module](https://github.com/kecorbin/cookiecutter-devnet-learning-module) or a [lab in an existing labs folder](https://github.com/kecorbin/cookiecutter-devnet-learning-lab).
You'll want to set up the structure of your Learning Labs project, which will resemble this:
```
├── labs
│   ├── sample-lab
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   └── custom-json.json
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   │   └── sample-html-project
│   │   ├── 1.md
│   │   ├── 2.md
│   │   ├── 3.md
│   │   ├── 4.md
│   │   ├── 5.md
│   │   ├── byod.html
|		|		└── sample-lab.json
```

* Lab content is in this repository in the `/labs` directory.
* The `labId` is used as the folder name for the lab, and the labs should be broken into individual markdown files numbered 1.md, 2.md, etc. corresponding to the lab step.

Details on the `byod.html` and `sample-lab.json` follow this section. There is an annotated version of the `sample-lab.json` that will provide you with details for each JSON property and its use.

Once you have created the basic structure, you should start using `git` to start tracking your changes. In order to publish into the Learning Labs platform, you will need to push to a GitHub repository (public or private). Currently, you'll have to work with the Learning Labs managers to actually gain access and publish. Contact details were mentioned at the beginning of this Learning Lab.
