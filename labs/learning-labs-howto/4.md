# Step 4: Store related images, videos, and code samples

In the assets directory, you should also have an images directory. The `images` is to be used for image files that you want to refer to in your Lab.

> Note: If you have code samples, you need to put those in a public GitHub repo, preferably submitted to the DevNet Code Exchange. Use that repo for any web page applications you want to include as part of your lab. Make sure you use CDNs for external libraries.

If you'd like to include video files, the DevNet team recommends uploading to YouTube or another video hosting platform, then linking to the video from within the Lab. Reach out to a DevNet administrator if you'd like to host a video or screencast in a DevNet YouTube channel.
