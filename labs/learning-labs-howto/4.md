### sample-lab.json

`sample-lab.json` should be renamed and match the `sample-lab` folder name. So for example if your Learning Lab will be called Cisco-CMX-100, under the labs folder you will have to rename the `sample-lab` folder to Cisco-CMX-100 and also the `sample-lab.json` file contained in this folder to Cisco-CMX-100.json. The contents of the json file are explained below:

The json key/value pairs are self-explanatory but we will go in a bit more details on the required parameters.

The `labId` is the ID of the Learning Lab. In the example given above this would be "labId": "Cisco-CMX-100". The `title` is the actual title of the lab. In our case this could be "title":"CMX-100: Introductory concepts". The `slug` key will contain the description of the lab. For our example it could be "slug":"Learn about Cisco's CMX technologies. An introductory Learning Lab". `time` should contain the amount of time that it takes to complete the lab. We already have a lot of tags that you can choose from when defining the `tags` values. For consistency please check the already available tags when adding the values for this parameter. The `files` key should contain a list of all the md files that comprise the Learning Lab.
