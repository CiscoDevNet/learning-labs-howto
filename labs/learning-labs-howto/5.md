# Step 5: Add Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) information

Author the `byod.html` ("bring your own device") file in HTML, placed in the directory at the same level with the JSON file and contain information about any special setup or requirements for completing the Learning Lab. If your lab requires to have Python installed, if you need to have special hardware or added software, put that information in `byod.html`. The system displays the content as a banner with a link at the top of your lab. Enable this by setting your lab JSON file property `"byod": true`.

Example file `byod.html`:
