## Step 8. Code examples
If your lab contains code examples, you should create a git project with your sample code. These examples will be hosted in GitHub, so that we can have lab participants
checkout appropriate tags and work in a read-only mode. You should include commentary in your lab on how to checkout the appropriate step. The [Angular JS tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00) is a good example of how to do this.

## Step 9. Video files
If you'd like to include video files, the DevNet team recommends uploading to YouTube or another video hosting platform, then linking to the video from within the Lab. Reach out to a DevNet administrator if you'd like to host a video or screencast in a DevNet YouTube channel.

# Conclusion
Once your Learning Lab is ready and you have all your files organized as explained in this lab, you are ready to publish your Learning Lab into the staging environment. We are using the staging environment to have a final look at our lab before we publish it into the production environment. If you are happy with how your Learning Lab is displayed in the staging environment you are ready to have the lab published in production and ready for prime time.

For publishing in both the staging and production environments you will have to contact the DevNet team via the methods explained at the beginning of this lab.
