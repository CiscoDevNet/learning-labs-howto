## Step 8. Code examples
If your lab contains code examples, you should create a git project with your sample code. These examples will be hosted in GitHub, so that we can have lab participants
checkout appropriate tags and work in a read-only mode. You should include commentary in your lab on how to checkout the appropriate step. The [Angular JS tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00) is a good example of how to do this.

## Step 9. Video files
If you'd like to include video files, you can use the HTML5 syntax like this. Since video files can be large, please work with the DevNet team to figure out the best way to add these to the repository and site.
```
<video poster="posts/files/virl/images/ml.02.png" width="480" height="300" none controls>
<source src="/virl-static/ml.02.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
```

# Conclusion
Once your Learning Lab is ready and you have all your files organized as explained in this lab, you are ready to publish your Learning Lab into the staging environment. We are using the staging environment to have a final look at our lab before we publish it into the production environment. If you are happy with how your Learning Lab is displayed in the staging environment you are ready to have the lab published in production and ready for prime time.

For publishing in both the staging and production environments you will have to contact the DevNet team via the methods explained at the beginning of this lab.
