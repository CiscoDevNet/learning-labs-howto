# Summary

Once your Learning Lab is ready and you have all your files organized as explained in this lab, you are ready to publish your Learning Lab into the staging environment. We are using the staging environment to have a final look at the Lab before we publish it into the production environment.

Once you are happy with your Learning Lab in the staging environment, you are ready to have the Lab published in production.

For publishing in both the staging and production environments, contact the DevNet team.
